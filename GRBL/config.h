// changes, Grbl will automatically include this data in the next status report, regardless of what the
// count is at the time. This helps reduce the communication overhead involved with high frequency reporting
// and agressive streaming. There is also a busy and an idle refresh count, which sets up Grbl to send
// refreshes more often when its not doing anything important. With a good GUI, this data doesn't need
// to be refreshed very often, on the order of a several seconds.

// The temporal resolution of the acceleration management subsystem. A higher number gives smoother

// impact performance. The correct value for this parameter is machine dependent, so it's advised to
// set this only as high as needed. Approximate successful values can widely range from 50 to 200 or more.
// NOTE: Changing this value also changes the execution time of a segment in the step segment buffer.
// When increasing this value, this stores less overall time in the segment buffer and vice versa. Make
// certain the step segment buffer is increased/decreased to account for these changes.

// Adaptive Multi-Axis Step Smoothing (AMASS) is an advanced feature that does what its name implies,
// smoothing the stepping of multi-axis motions. This feature smooths motion particularly at low step
// frequencies below 10kHz, where the aliasing between axes of multi-axis motions can cause audible
// noise and shake your machine. At even lower step frequencies, AMASS adapts and provides even better
// step smoothing. See stepper.c for more details on the AMASS system works.
#define ADAPTIVE_MULTI_AXIS_STEP_SMOOTHING  // Default enabled. Comment to disable.

// Define Adaptive Multi-Axis Step-Smoothing(AMASS) levels and cutoff frequencies. The highest level
// frequency bin starts at 0Hz and ends at its cutoff frequency. The next lower level frequency bin
// starts at the next higher cutoff frequency, and so on. The cutoff frequencies for each level must
// be considered carefully against how much it over-drives the stepper ISR, the accuracy of the 16-bit
// timer, and the CPU overhead. Level 0 (no AMASS, normal operation) frequency bin starts at the
// Level 1 cutoff frequency and up to as fast as the CPU allows (over 30kHz in limited testing).
// NOTE: AMASS cutoff frequency multiplied by ISR overdrive factor must not exceed maximum step frequency.
// NOTE: Current settings are set to overdrive the ISR to no more than 16kHz, balancing CPU overhead
// and timer accuracy.  Do not alter these settings unless you know what you are doing.

// Sets the maximum step rate allowed to be written as a Grbl setting. This option enables an error

// With this enabled, Grbl sends back an echo of the line it has received, which has been pre-parsed (spaces
// removed, capitalized letters, no comments) and is to be immediately executed by Grbl. Echoes will not be
// sent upon a line buffer overflow, but should for all normal lines sent to Grbl. For example, if a user
// sendss the line 'g1 x1.032 y2.45 (test comment)', Grbl will echo back in the form '[echo: G1X1.032Y2.45]'.
// NOTE: Only use this for debugging purposes!! When echoing, this takes up valuable resources and can effect
// performance. If absolutely needed for normal operation, the serial write buffer should be greatly increased
// to help minimize transmission waiting within the serial write protocol.

// Minimum planner junction speed. Sets the default minimum junction speed the planner plans to at
// every buffer block junction, except for starting from rest and end of the buffer, which are always

// limits or angle between neighboring block line move directions. This is useful for machines that can't
// tolerate the tool dwelling for a split second, i.e. 3d printers or laser cutters. If used, this value
// should not be much greater than zero or to the minimum value necessary for the machine to work.
#define MINIMUM_JUNCTION_SPEED 0.0f // (mm/min)

// Sets the minimum feed rate the planner will allow. Any value below it will be set to this minimum
// value. This also ensures that a planned motion always completes and accounts for any floating-point
// round-off errors. Although not recommended, a lower value than 1.0 mm/min will likely work in smaller
// machines, perhaps to 0.1mm/min, but your success may vary based on multiple factors.
#define MINIMUM_FEED_RATE 1.0f // (mm/min)

// Number of arc generation iterations by small angle approximation before exact arc trajectory

// bogged down by too many trig calculations.
#define N_ARC_CORRECTION 12 // Integer (1-255)

// The arc G2/3 g-code standard is problematic by definition. Radius-based arcs have horrible numerical
// errors when arc at semi-circles(pi) or full-circles(2*pi). Offset-based arcs are much more accurate
// but still have a problem when arcs are full-circles (2*pi). This define accounts for the floating
// point issues when offset-based arcs are commanded as full circles, but get interpreted as extremely
// small arcs with around machine epsilon (1.2e-7rad) due to numerical round-off and precision issues.
// This define value sets the machine epsilon cutoff to determine if the arc is a full-circle or not.
// NOTE: Be very careful when adjusting this value. It should always be greater than 1.2e-7 but not too
// much greater than this. The default setting should capture most, if not all, full arc error situations.
#define ARC_ANGULAR_TRAVEL_EPSILON 5E-7f // Float (radians)

// Time delay increments performed during a dwell. The default value is set at 50ms, which provides
// a maximum time delay of roughly 55 minutes, more than enough for most any application. Increasing

// run-time command executions, like status reports, since these are performed between each dwell
// time step.
#define DWELL_TIME_STEP 50 // Integer (1-255) (milliseconds)

// The number of linear motions in the planner buffer to be planned at any give time. The vast
// majority of RAM that Grbl uses is based on this buffer size. Only increase if there is extra
// available RAM, like when re-compiling for MCU with ample amounts of RAM. Or decrease if the MCU begins to
// crash due to the lack of available RAM or if the CPU is having trouble keeping up with planning
// new incoming motions as they are executed.
// #define BLOCK_BUFFER_SIZE 16 // Uncomment to override default in planner.h.

// Governs the size of the intermediary step segment buffer between the step execution algorithm
// and the planner blocks. Each segment is set of steps executed at a constant velocity over a
// fixed time defined by ACCELERATION_TICKS_PER_SECOND. They are computed such that the planner
// block velocity profile is traced exactly. The size of this buffer governs how much step
// execution lead time there is for other Grbl processes have to compute and do their thing
// before having to come back and refill this buffer, currently at ~50msec of step moves.
// #define SEGMENT_BUFFER_SIZE 6 // Uncomment to override default in stepper.h.

// Force Grbl to check the state of the hard limit switches when the processor detects a pin
// change inside the hard limit ISR routine. By default, Grbl will trigger the hard limits
// alarm upon any pin change, since bouncing switches can cause a state check like this to
// misread the pin. When hard limits are triggered, they should be 100% reliable, which is the
// reason that this option is disabled by default. Only if your system/electronics can guarantee
// that the switches don't bounce, we recommend enabling this option. This will help prevent

// Adjusts homing cycle search and locate scalars. These are the multipliers used by Grbl's

// In Grbl v0.9 and prior, there is an old outstanding bug where the `WPos:` work position reported
